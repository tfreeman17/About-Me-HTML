				Most of my mom's side of the family, minus my Uncle Perry and Aunt Ana and their 4 kids. This was a pretty good looking outfit, if I do say so myself purple and stripes with red tights, born to be weird!

				<img src="artwork.jpg" alt ="Artpeice">
				<br>
				This is one of my art peices I made in college that one awards, which was the first time besides elementary school that I won an award for something I made. The are cast sheep hearts that I got from the butcher school at CSU and I made a mold and cast a polyurthane resin into it and tried to produce similar results to enjection molding by constantly moving the mold with the resin inside as to create a thin layer like skin to evoke a more glass like texture.

				This was a bedframe I made for one of my friends out of reclaimed barn wood. It started as 1 peice of wood that I got for about 5$ and then the hardward and sanding materials. Total it cost me about 25$ to produce and it was the first peice of funiture I sold.
